**Analyzing the effect of common input on the rate of synchronous spiking between neurons**

In analyzing spike recordings of neurons it is often scientifically interesting to analyze whether two neurons spike together or not. For example, [Martin and von der Heydt (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25926461) found that border ownership neurons in V2 spike synchronously when their associated receptive fields are part of the same perceived object. They also found that attention modulates the rate of synchronous spiking. In this work we analyze how to interpret that finding, showing that just from the change in synchronous spiking and the overal firing rates of the neurons, the amount of common input to the recorded neurons is unidentifiable.

**Closed form jitter analysis of neuronal spike trains**

When looking at the rate of synchronous spiking between neurons, it is very important to have a time scale of comparison. [Amarasingham et al (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3349623/) developed a statistically rigorous way to control for slowly varying spike rates of two neurons while analyzing their synchronous activity using Monte Carlo methods. We developed a way to perform the analysis in closed form and demonstrated the increase in speed.
