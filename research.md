**Measuring visual attention using finger taps on a tablet**

In the study of visual attention, we draw a distinction between cases where top-down cues drive attention, for example when you're looking for a specific object, and situations where bottom up cues attract attention like when you see a ball flying towards you out of the corner of your eye. In most studies of how strong certain bottom-up cues are (also called the [visual salience](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Visual_salience) of an object) subjects are either told what to look for or perform many so repeated trials that they know very well what will happen next. In order to avoid this kind of top-down cue, we developed a method to be used on a tablet computer outdoors so that many subjects could participate without having many repeated trials of our experiment. We also compared responses between the tablet experiment and more controlled conditions.

**Analyzing the effect of common input on the rate of synchronous spiking between neurons**

In analyzing spike recordings of neurons it is often scientifically interesting to analyze whether two neurons spike together or not. For example, [Martin and von der Heydt (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25926461) found that border ownership neurons in V2 spike synchronously when their associated receptive fields are part of the same perceived object. They also found that attention modulates the rate of synchronous spiking. In this work we analyze how to interpret that finding, showing that just from the change in synchronous spiking and the overal firing rates of the neurons, the amount of common input to the recorded neurons is unidentifiable.

**Closed form jitter analysis of neuronal spike trains**
<img style="float: right;" src="http://dannyjeck.github.io/img/fig_computation_time.png" width="250">

When looking at the rate of synchronous spiking between neurons, it is very important to have a time scale of comparison. [Amarasingham et al (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3349623/) developed a statistically rigorous way to control for slowly varying spike rates of two neurons while analyzing their synchronous activity using Monte Carlo methods. We developed a way to perform the analysis in closed form and demonstrated the increase in speed.
