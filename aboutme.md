I'm currently a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University pursuing a PhD in [biomedical engineering](http://www.bme.jhu.edu/), with a focus on computational neuroscience and computer vision. I work with [Ernst Niebur](http://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/89) in the Solomon H. Snyder Department of Neuroscience. My [research](https://dannyjeck.github.io/research/) is centered on modeling and understanding what aspects of an image attract visual attention, usually measured by eye fixations. I'm also interested using results from human behavioral studies to motivate improvements in computer vision algorithms. You can contact me [here](mailto:danny.jeck@gmail.com).
